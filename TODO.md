Okay, let's break down the ContextNexus project based on the provided code.

## Code Structure Summary

The project is structured as a full-stack application with a clear separation between the frontend (React) and the backend (Node.js/Express).  It follows a clean architecture pattern, with well-defined layers for data access, business logic, API exposure, and UI presentation.

**1. Backend (`src`)**

*   **`api`**: This is the presentation layer, responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses.
    *   `middlewares`: Reusable Express middleware functions for authentication (`auth.ts`), error handling (`error-handler.ts`), and request validation (`validation.ts`).
    *   `routes`: Defines the API endpoints, grouping related routes into separate files (e.g., `user-routes.ts`, `project-routes.ts`).
    *   `controllers`: Contains the route handler logic, interacting with services to fulfill requests.  Each controller focuses on a specific resource (user, project, context, content).
    *   `validators`:  Contains Joi validation schemas for request data (input validation).

*   **`config`**: Configuration files.
    *   `app-config.ts`:  Centralized configuration using environment variables, covering server settings, database connections, API keys, etc.
    *   `container.ts`:  Implements a basic dependency injection container, a core component of clean architecture.

*   **`db`**: Database connection and migration scripts.
    *   `postgres`: PostgreSQL connection setup (`connection.ts`).  Provides utility functions for querying and transactions.
    *   `neo4j`: Neo4j connection setup (`connection.ts`). Includes utility functions for running Cypher queries.
    *   `minio`: MinIO connection setup for object storage (e.g., images, files).
    *   `pinecone`: Pinecone connection setup for vector embeddings.

*   **`repositories`**:  Data access layer. Implements the Repository pattern, providing an abstraction over data sources.
    *   `interfaces.ts`: Defines the interfaces for all repositories, ensuring consistency.
    *   `postgres`: Contains repository implementations using PostgreSQL (e.g., `user-repository.ts`, `project-repository.ts`).
    *   `neo4j`: Contains the `graph-repository.ts` for Neo4j interactions.
    *   `minio`: Contains the `object-repository.ts` for MinIO interactions.
    *   `pinecone`: Contains the `vector-repository.ts` for Pinecone interactions.

*   **`services`**: Business logic layer.  Contains services that orchestrate operations using repositories and other services.
    *   `auth-service.ts`: Handles user authentication and authorization (JWT, token refresh).
    *   `content-service.ts`, `context-service.ts`, `project-service.ts`: Services for managing core domain objects.
    *   `llm`: Contains LLM integration logic (e.g., `connectors`, `prompt-builder.ts`, `model-registry.ts`, `context-optimizer.ts`).
    *    `selection`: Contains logic for the `RelevanceScorer` and `selection-service`

*   **`types`**: TypeScript type definitions for domain entities (e.g., `User`, `Project`, `Context`, `ContentItem`) and other data structures.

*   **`utils`**: Utility functions and classes.
    *   `errors.ts`: Custom error classes for consistent error handling.
    *   `logger.ts`: Logging utility (using Winston).
    *   `token-counter.ts`: Utility for counting tokens in text (likely using `gpt-tokenizer`).

*   **`app.ts`**:  Express application setup.  Middleware configuration, route registration, and error handling.

*   **`server.ts`**: Server entry point. Starts the Express server.

**2. Frontend (`frontend`)**

*   **`public`**: Static assets (not shown in your code dump, but standard for Create React App).
*   **`src`**:
    *   `components`:  React components, organized by feature/domain (e.g., `auth`, `context`, `layout`).
    *   `services`:  Frontend services, including the `api-client.ts` for communicating with the backend API, and `auth-service.ts` for managing frontend authentication state.
    *   `store`:  Redux store for global state management.  Includes slices (e.g., `authSlice.ts`, `contextSelectionSlice.ts`) and thunks for asynchronous actions.
    *   `types`:  TypeScript type definitions specific to the frontend.
    *   `App.tsx`:  Root component, setting up routing and global providers.
    *   `index.tsx`: Entry point for the React application.
    *  `hooks`: contains custom react hooks
    *  `mocks`: appears to contain MSW for mock API calls
    *  `i18n`: internationalization configuration


**3. Other Files**
*  `package.json` for npm
*  `tsconfig.json` for typescript configuration
*  `.eslintrc.json` for eslint configuration

## Next Steps and Prioritization

Based on my analysis and your stated goals, here's a prioritized list of the *immediate* next steps:

1.  **Complete Authentication and Authorization:** You've got the `UserRepository` done, but the `AuthService` and middleware are crucial for securing the API.  Finish implementing the `login`, `register`, `validateToken`, and `refreshToken` methods in `AuthService`.  Implement the `authMiddleware` to protect routes.  Create the `user-controller.ts` and `user-routes.ts` to expose these endpoints.

2.  **Basic LLM Interaction:**
    -   Implement the `LLMConnector` interface (already started with the OpenAI connector).
    -   Create a simple `QueryService` that can take a prompt and context ID, and return a response from the LLM. This is the *core* functionality of ContextNexus.
    -  Implement the query route/controller.

3.  **Basic Context Selection UI:** You need a way for the user to provide content and see the LLM's response.
    -   Build a basic `ContextSelector` component.  Initially, it can just list content items with checkboxes.
    -   Connect the selection UI to Redux to track selected/deselected items.
    -   Integrate with the `QueryService` to send selected content as context.
    -   Display the LLM response.

4.  **Context Optimization (Initial Implementation):**
    -   Implement the `ContextOptimizer` class.
    -   Start with a simple selection strategy (e.g., take the first *N* paragraphs until the token limit is reached).  Later, you'll add relevance scoring.

Once you have these four steps completed, you'll have a functional (though basic) version of ContextNexus where:

*   Users can log in and register.
*   You can pre-populate some content (e.g., via database seed scripts).
*   Users can select content items.
*   Users can send a query with the selected content as context.
*   The system sends the prompt to the LLM and displays the response.

This establishes the core value proposition and allows for further iterative development of advanced features.

**Recommendation for next step:**  I strongly recommend starting with **Step 1: Complete Authentication and Authorization.** This is critical for security and is a prerequisite for any user-specific features. Get `AuthService` and the related routes and middleware working first.
