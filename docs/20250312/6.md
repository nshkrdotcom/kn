## Summary of Completed Components

1. **User Repository and Authentication**
   - Implemented PostgresUserRepository for user data management
   - Created AuthService for JWT-based authentication
   - Built authentication middleware for secure API access
   - Added user routes and controller with validation

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Created a simple DI container for managing dependencies
   - Registered repositories, services, and controllers
   - Simplified component instantiation and testing

3. **LLM Integration Layer**
   - Designed LLMConnector interface for provider abstraction
   - Implemented OpenAIConnector for GPT integration
   - Created ModelRegistry for managing multiple LLM providers
   - Built LLMService for managing context-aware LLM interactions

4. **Query API Endpoint**
   - Added query controller and routes for LLM interaction
   - Implemented streaming response capability
   - Created validators for request validation
   - Built context assembly for LLM prompts

## Next Steps

1. **Context Optimization Logic**
   - Implement more intelligent content selection
   - Add token budget management
   - Develop relevance scoring algorithms

2. **Advanced Selection & Relevance**
   - Build UI-driven selection capabilities
   - Implement vector-based relevance scoring
   - Create user preference-aware selection

3. **Knowledge Graph Enhancements**
   - Improve relationship discovery
   - Develop visualization data endpoints
   - Build context branching functionality

Would you like me to continue with implementing any of these next steps?
