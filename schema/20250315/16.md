Okay, let's design a detailed vector embedding schema. Given your existing PostgreSQL infrastructure and the desire for tight integration, **pgvector** is an excellent choice. While external vector databases like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Qdrant offer specialized features and scalability, pgvector provides a good balance of performance, simplicity, and ease of integration *within* your existing PostgreSQL environment. It avoids the added complexity of managing and synchronizing with a separate database.

**Technology Choice Justification: pgvector**

*   **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with your existing PostgreSQL schema and queries. No need for separate connection management or data synchronization.
*   **Simplicity:** Easy to install (as a PostgreSQL extension) and use. Requires minimal changes to your application code.
*   **Performance:** Good performance for moderate-sized datasets (millions of vectors). Can be further optimized with indexing.
*   **Cost-Effective:** No additional infrastructure costs if you're already using PostgreSQL.
*   **Transactional Consistency:** Vector operations are part of your PostgreSQL transactions, ensuring data consistency.
*   **Full SQL Access:** You can combine vector search with other SQL features (filtering, joining, aggregations) in a single query.

**Schema Design**

We'll extend the existing `content_chunks` table to store the embeddings.  This is the most logical place, as embeddings are typically generated for smaller units of text.

```sql
-- Modifications to the content_chunks table
ALTER TABLE content_chunks
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS embedding; -- Remove the old embedding column (if it was a generic type)

ALTER TABLE content_chunks
ADD COLUMN embedding vector(1536); -- Add the pgvector column. 1536 is for OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002

-- Create an index for faster similarity search.
-- Choose ONE of the following index types (IVFFlat is generally recommended to start):

-- Option 1: IVFFlat (Inverted File with Flat Clustering) - Good for most use cases
CREATE INDEX ON content_chunks USING ivfflat (embedding vector_ip_ops) WITH (lists = 100); -- Adjust 'lists' based on dataset size

-- Option 2: HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) - Good for high-dimensional data and high recall
-- CREATE INDEX ON content_chunks USING hnsw (embedding vector_ip_ops) WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);

-- Option 3: (Postgres 16+)
CREATE INDEX ON public.content_chunks USING hnsw (embedding vector_ip_ops) WITH (dim='1536', m='16', ef_construction='64', ef='10');

-- Function to set the number of lists for IVFFlat (tune this!)
-- VACUUM ANALYZE content_chunks; -- after adding a good chunk of data run this to update the stats
-- SELECT set_limit(0.9);  -- Adjust this; it's an appropriate setting for recall

-- Function to calculate inner product distance (for relevance ranking with an RRF approach, discussed later)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION inner_product_distance(vector, vector)
RETURNS float8
AS 'MODULE_PATHNAME', 'vector_ip_dist'
LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT PARALLEL SAFE;

-- Operator for inner product distance
CREATE OPERATOR <#> (
  LEFTARG = vector,
  RIGHTARG = vector,
  PROCEDURE = inner_product_distance,
  COMMUTATOR = '<#>'
);

-- (Optional, for later) RRF aggregation function and operator
-- requires the multirange and aggs_for_arrays extensions
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS multirange;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS aggs_for_arrays;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION rrf_combine(internal, next_rank_array smallint[])
RETURNS internal
AS 'MODULE_PATHNAME'
LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE PARALLEL SAFE;

CREATE AGGREGATE rrf(smallint[]) (
    SFUNC = rrf_combine,
    STYPE = internal,
    COMBINEFUNC = rrf_combine,
    PARALLEL = SAFE
);
```

**Explanation and Key Considerations:**

1.  **`embedding vector(1536)`:**
    *   `vector(1536)`: This defines a column named `embedding` that stores a vector (array) of floating-point numbers.  The `1536` specifies the dimensionality of the vector.  This corresponds to the output dimension of OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model.  If you use a different embedding model, adjust this number accordingly.  *Always use the correct dimensionality for your chosen embedding model.*
    *   **Embedding Model Choice:** OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` is a good, cost-effective choice.  Other options include models from Cohere, Google (Vertex AI), or open-source models (Sentence Transformers). The best choice depends on your specific needs (accuracy, cost, latency).

2.  **Indexing:**
    *   **Why Indexing is Crucial:** Without an index, calculating vector similarity requires comparing the query vector to *every* vector in the table (a full scan).  This is extremely slow for even moderately sized datasets.
    *   **IVFFlat (Inverted File with Flat Clustering):**  This is a good default choice for pgvector.
        *   `lists = 100`: This parameter divides the vectors into `lists` clusters. During a search, pgvector only needs to compare the query vector to the vectors in the closest clusters.  Tuning `lists` is crucial for performance:
            *   **Rule of Thumb:**  A good starting point is `rows / 1000` for datasets up to 1M rows, and `sqrt(rows)` for larger datasets.
            *   **Tuning:**  Experiment with different values of `lists` and measure the query performance and recall (how many of the truly relevant results are returned).
            * **Setting `probes`:** You can change the number of probes at query time using `SET LOCAL ivfflat.probes = 10;` (or another value. This will affect query time and accuracy; more probes means longer queries but more accurate results)
    *   **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World):**  Generally provides better performance than IVFFlat for very high-dimensional data and high recall requirements, but has a higher indexing time and memory usage.  If you need the absolute best performance and are willing to spend more time on indexing, consider HNSW. Tuning:  `m` (number of connections per node) and `ef_construction` (size of the dynamic candidate list during index construction) are important parameters to tune.
     * **`vector_ip_ops`:** The *operator class* for the inner product.  pgvector supports three operator classes:
        *   `vector_l2_ops`:  For Euclidean distance (L2 distance).
        *   `vector_ip_ops`:  For inner product (which is related to cosine similarity).
        *   `vector_cosine_ops`:  For cosine distance.
        Since you're likely to calculate cosine similarity of the normalized vectors from the LLM, `vector_ip_ops` or `vector_cosine_ops` will work for you. If your vectors are already normalized to unit length (which is typical for embeddings from many models), the inner product *is* the cosine similarity.
        If your vectors are NOT normalised you should normalise them on ingestion.
    * **Reindexing:** after making *large* changes to your embedding data (adding many new embeddings or changing the embeddings of existing records), you should `REINDEX` the index to maintain performance.

3. **Operator `<#>`**: This creates a custom operator which will be useful when querying (you can also use `<->` for L2 and `<=>` for cosine)

4. **RRF Aggregation (Optional):**
    *   **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):** A technique for combining results from multiple ranked lists (e.g., combining results from a vector similarity search and a full-text search). The aggregate `rrf` and the `rrf_combine` function will be useful for this.
    *   **Extensions:** `multirange` and `aggs_for_arrays` are required for RRF.

**Workflow**

1.  **Content Ingestion:** When new content is added to the system (or existing content is updated):
    *   The content is split into chunks (if necessary).  Appropriate chunking is *critical* for good embedding quality.  Consider semantic chunking (splitting based on sentences, paragraphs, or sections) rather than fixed-size chunks.
    *   For each chunk, you call the embedding API (e.g., OpenAI's embedding endpoint) to generate the vector embedding.
    *   The chunk text *and* the embedding vector are stored in the `content_chunks` table.

2.  **Querying (Similarity Search):**
    *   A user enters a query.
    *   Your application calls the embedding API to generate an embedding vector for the query.
    *   You construct a SQL query using pgvector's similarity operators:

        ```sql
        -- Example using inner product (assuming normalized vectors)
        SELECT
            content_id,
            chunk_index,
            content,
            1 - (embedding <#> $1) AS similarity  -- Calculate cosine similarity (1 - inner product distance)
        FROM content_chunks
        WHERE tenant_id = $2  -- Always filter by tenant!
        ORDER BY similarity DESC
        LIMIT 10;
        ```

        *   `$1`:  The query embedding vector (passed as a parameter).
        *   `$2`:  The current tenant ID.
        *  `1 - (embedding <#> $1)`: The inner product operator calculates the distance; subtracting it from 1 is useful for ordering/readability.
        *   `ORDER BY similarity DESC`: Orders the results by similarity (highest similarity first).
        *   `LIMIT 10`:  Returns the top 10 most similar chunks.

3.  **Hybrid Search (Optional - using RRF):**
    If you want to combine vector search with full-text search, you can use RRF:

    ```sql
    WITH vector_search AS (
        SELECT
            id,
            1 - (embedding <#> $1) AS similarity,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY embedding <#> $1) as rank
        FROM content_chunks
        WHERE tenant_id = $3
    ),
    full_text_search AS (
        SELECT
            id,
            ts_rank_cd(to_tsvector('english', content), plainto_tsquery('english', $2)) AS similarity,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (order by ts_rank_cd(to_tsvector('english', content), plainto_tsquery('english', $2)) DESC) as rank
        FROM content_chunks
        WHERE tenant_id = $3
          AND to_tsvector('english', content) @@ plainto_tsquery('english', $2)
    )
    SELECT id, sum(similarity)
    	FROM (
    		SELECT * from vector_search
    		UNION ALL
    		SELECT * FROM full_text_search
    	) as sub
    	GROUP BY id
        ORDER BY sum(similarity) DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

    *   `$1`: Query embedding vector.
    *   `$2`:  The user's search query (text).
    *   `$3`:  The current tenant ID.
    *   This query performs *both* a vector similarity search and a full-text search, then combines the results using a simple sum of the similarity score.  You could adapt it to use `rrf` for a more sophisticated combination.

**Important Considerations and Best Practices**

*   **Embedding Model Selection:** Choose an embedding model that is appropriate for your data and task.  Consider factors like accuracy, cost, latency, and the type of similarity you want to capture (e.g., semantic similarity, topic similarity).
*   **Chunking Strategy:**  Experiment with different chunking strategies to find what works best for your content.  Semantic chunking is generally preferred.
*   **Index Tuning:**  Tune the `lists` (IVFFlat) or `m` and `ef_construction` (HNSW) parameters based on your data size and performance requirements.  Start with the rule-of-thumb values and then experiment.  Use `VACUUM ANALYZE` after significant data changes.
*   **Normalization:** Ensure that your embeddings are normalized (have a length of 1). Most embedding APIs (like OpenAI's) return normalized vectors by default.
*   **Metadata Filtering:**  You can combine vector search with metadata filtering (e.g., filtering by project, date, or tags) using standard SQL `WHERE` clauses.
*   **Distance Metrics:** Understand the relationship between inner product, cosine similarity, and Euclidean distance. For normalized vectors, the inner product *is* the cosine similarity.
*   **Relevance Threshold:** You might want to set a minimum similarity threshold to filter out irrelevant results.
*   **Security:**  Protect your embedding API key. Store it securely (e.g., using environment variables or a secrets manager).

By following this detailed schema design and incorporating these best practices, you can effectively leverage pgvector to add powerful vector search capabilities to your ContextNexus application, enhancing its ability to find and relate information based on semantic meaning. This all integrates naturally into your current architecture.
