Okay, let's walk through the PostgreSQL schema, focusing on how each table interacts with the system, relates to higher-level code abstractions, and is experienced by the user. I'll avoid detailing individual fields and instead focus on the table's role and relationships.

**1. Tenant Management**

*   **`tenants`:**
    *   **System Interaction:** This is the *root* of multi-tenancy. Every other record in the database (except `tenant_audit_log` itself) belongs to a tenant.  It controls feature sets, branding, and user/storage limits.  When a user logs in, the system determines their tenant based on their email or the subdomain they're accessing.  All subsequent queries are filtered by `tenant_id`.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  Likely represented as a `Tenant` model/class in your application code.  This model would be used for managing tenant settings, billing, etc.  A `TenantContext` or similar might be used to store the current tenant throughout a request.
    *   **User Experience:**  End-users don't directly interact with this table *as a table*.  However, the tenant's settings (features, theme, domain) directly affect their experience.  Tenant administrators would have a dedicated interface (likely built on top of the `Tenant` model) to manage these settings. The concept of a "tenant" would map to an organization or company that uses the system.
    * **Example:** A company, "Acme Corp," signs up. A new `tenants` record is created. All of Acme Corp's users, projects, and data will be associated with this tenant ID. Another company, "Beta Industries," signs up. Their data is entirely separate.

*   **`tenant_audit_log`:**
    *   **System Interaction:** Tracks changes to tenant settings (who changed what, when). This is crucial for security and compliance. It's a write-only table (typically, no updates or deletes).
    *   **Code Abstraction:** Might be managed via a generic `AuditLogService` or directly through database triggers.
    *   **User Experience:** Typically only visible to super-admins or auditors.  Provides a history of changes to tenant configurations.
    * **Example:** An admin at Acme Corp enables a new feature. A record is added to `tenant_audit_log` recording this action, the admin's ID, the timestamp, and the specific change.

**2. User Management**

*   **`users`:**
    *   **System Interaction:** Stores user accounts *within* a tenant.  Handles authentication (password hashing), authorization (roles, permissions), and user profile information.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  Represented as a `User` model.  This is one of the most critical models in your application, used everywhere user data is needed. Authentication and authorization logic will heavily rely on this model.
    *   **User Experience:**  Users interact with this through login, registration, profile editing, and potentially user management interfaces (if they have admin privileges).
        * **Example:** Jane Doe signs up for Acme Corp's instance of ContextNexus. A `users` record is created with her email, password hash, etc. Her `tenant_id` links her to Acme Corp.

*   **`user_activity`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  Logs user actions (e.g., "created project," "edited document," "viewed thread").  Used for analytics, debugging, and auditing.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  Likely handled by an `ActivityService` or similar, which might be triggered by events in your application.
    *   **User Experience:**  May be exposed to users in the form of an "activity feed" or used internally for support and troubleshooting.
    * **Example:** Jane Doe creates a new project. A record is added to `user_activity`, noting the action, the user, the timestamp, and the project ID.

**3. Program and Project Management**

*   **`programs`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  A top-level organizational unit *within* a tenant.  Provides a way to group related projects.
    *   **Code Abstraction:** Represented as a `Program` model.  This model would handle program-level settings and metadata.
    *   **User Experience:**  Users might see a list of programs they have access to and can create or manage projects within those programs.  This adds a level of organization above projects.
      * **Example:**  Acme Corp might have a "Marketing" program and an "Engineering" program.

*   **`projects`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  The core unit of work.  Contains threads, content items, and user memberships.  Most user activity revolves around projects.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  A `Project` model.  This model will have relationships to users, threads, and content items. It's a central hub for much of the application's logic.
    *   **User Experience:**  The primary workspace for users. They'll create projects, add content, collaborate with others, and manage project settings. This is what users will spend most of their time working within.
        * **Example:** Within the "Marketing" program, there might be a project called "Q4 Campaign."

*   **`project_memberships`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  Defines which users have access to which projects and what their roles/permissions are within those projects. This is a *many-to-many* relationship between `users` and `projects`.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  Often handled implicitly through relationships in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks.  You might have a `Project.members` property that manages this.
    *   **User Experience:**  Users might see a list of project members and their roles.  Project admins can manage memberships and permissions. This determines who can see and do what within a project.
        * **Example:** Jane Doe is added to the "Q4 Campaign" project with the "Editor" role.  This is recorded in `project_memberships`.

**4. Thread Management**

*   **`threads`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  Represents a specific context or discussion within a project.  Contains content items and messages, forming a coherent unit of knowledge.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  A `Thread` model.  This model will manage thread metadata, relationships to content items and messages, and potentially thread-specific settings.
    *   **User Experience:**  Users create, view, and navigate threads. They add content to threads, participate in conversations, and explore the knowledge within a thread. This is where the core "context" of ContextNexus is represented.
      * **Example:** Within the "Q4 Campaign" project, there might be a thread called "Competitor Analysis."

*   **`thread_relationships`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  Defines parent-child relationships *between* threads, allowing for hierarchical organization of knowledge.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  Often managed through self-referential relationships in ORM frameworks.  You might have a `Thread.children` or `Thread.parent` property.
    *   **User Experience:**  Allows users to create nested threads, organize knowledge into subtopics, and navigate the thread hierarchy.
        * **Example:** Within the "Competitor Analysis" thread, there might be sub-threads for "Competitor A," "Competitor B," and so on.

**5. Content Management**

*   **`storage_types`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  Defines the *available* storage backends (PostgreSQL, MinIO, S3, etc.).  Allows for flexible storage options. This is an *extensible enum pattern*.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  Likely represented as a set of configuration options and potentially a `StorageService` that handles interactions with different storage backends.
    *   **User Experience:**  Generally invisible to end-users.  Administrators might configure storage types during setup.

*   **`content_types`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  Defines the *types* of content that can be stored (text, code, image, PDF, etc.).  This is another *extensible enum pattern*.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  Likely represented as constants or an enum in your code.  May be associated with specific content handler classes.
    *   **User Experience:**  Users might select a content type when uploading or creating content.  This determines how the content is handled and displayed.

*   **`content_items`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  The *central* table for managing content.  Stores metadata about content, regardless of where the actual content data is stored (determined by `storage_type`).
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  A `ContentItem` model (or perhaps an abstract base class with subclasses for specific content types). This is a core model for managing content metadata, versions, and relationships.
    *   **User Experience:** Represents the individual pieces of content that users add to the system (documents, images, code snippets, etc.). Users will interact with content items in various ways, such as viewing, editing, and adding them to threads. This is a fundamental building block of the system.
        * **Example:** Jane Doe uploads a PDF document.  A `content_items` record is created, storing the title, description, storage location (e.g., a key in S3), and other metadata.

*   **`text_content`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  Stores the *textual content* of `content_items` that are of type "text." This is a *one-to-one* relationship with `content_items`.
    *   **Code Abstraction:** Likely a subclass of `ContentItem` (e.g., `TextContent`).
    *   **User Experience:**  Holds the actual text that users see and edit when working with text content.

*   **`code_content`:**
    *   **System Interaction:** Stores the *code content* of `content_items` of type "code."  Also a *one-to-one* relationship.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  Likely a subclass of `ContentItem` (e.g., `CodeContent`).
    *   **User Experience:** Holds the code that users see and edit, with potential syntax highlighting.

*   **`content_chunks`:**
    *   **System Interactions:** Used for breaking down larger content (mainly text) into smaller, manageable pieces, especially for LLM context and vector search.
    * **Code Abstraction**: Likely a `ContentChunk` model that has a relationship to a `ContentItem`. Your code will handle the logic of splitting content into chunks and managing embeddings.
    *   **User Experience:**  Invisible to the user directly.  Improves search and LLM interaction by allowing the system to work with smaller pieces of content.
      * **Example:**  The PDF document Jane Doe uploaded is split into chunks, each with its own text and vector embedding, allowing for semantic search within the document.

*   **`content_versions`:**
    * **System Interaction:** Manages the version history of `content_items`. Each change to a content item creates a new version.
    * **Code Abstraction**: A `ContentVersion` model related to `ContentItem`. Version control logic will be implemented using this model.
    * **User Experience:** Allows users to view previous versions of content, revert to older versions, and see the history of changes. This is crucial for collaboration and auditability.

*   **`document_snapshots`:**
      *   **System Interaction:** Stores complete snapshots of content items at specific points in time, optimized for faster loading of CRDT documents.
      *   **Code Abstraction:** A `DocumentSnapshot` model related to the `ContentItem`. This would interact with the CRDT library you use.
      *   **User Experience:**  Improves performance by allowing quick loading of documents, especially when dealing with many collaborative edits.

*    **`tags`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  Allows users to categorize and organize content items with keywords.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  A `Tag` model.
    *   **User Experience:**  Users can create, apply, and search for tags to find relevant content.

*   **`content_tags`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  A *many-to-many* relationship between `content_items` and `tags`.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  Often handled implicitly through ORM relationships.
    *   **User Experience:**  Connects tags to content items, enabling tag-based search and filtering.
    * **Example:** Jane Doe creates a tag "Marketing" and applies to content. The "Q4 Campaign" project has that tag and the records connect

*   **`thread_content`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  A *many-to-many* relationship between `threads` and `content_items`.  Defines which content items are included in which threads, along with relevance scores and other metadata.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  Often handled through ORM relationships. You might have a `Thread.content_items` property.
    *   **User Experience:**  This is how content is associated with threads. Users add content to threads, and this table tracks those associations. The `relevance_score` and `inclusion_method` are important for how the system prioritizes and selects content for LLM context.

**6. LLM and Prompt Management**

*   **`llm_models`:**
    *   **System Interaction:** Defines the available LLM models (GPT-4, Claude-2, etc.) that the system can use. Stores model metadata, such as provider, max tokens, and pricing.
    *   **Code Abstraction:** Likely an `LLMModel` model or a set of configuration options.  A `LLMService` would use this information to interact with different LLM APIs.
    *   **User Experience:** Generally invisible to end-users, *unless* you provide a way for users to select different models for different tasks. Administrators might configure available models.
    * **Example:** The system needs to generate a summary. The `LLMService` looks at `llm_models`, sees that GPT-4 is enabled, and uses the OpenAI API to generate the summary.

*   **`prompt_templates`:**
    *   **System Interaction:** Stores pre-defined prompt templates that can be used to interact with LLMs.  Allows for consistent and reusable prompts.
    *   **Code Abstraction:** A `PromptTemplate` model.  Your application code would use this model to render prompts with variables and manage template versions.
    *   **User Experience:**  Users might be able to create, edit, and select prompt templates when interacting with LLMs. This allows for more structured and repeatable interactions.
    * **Example:** A template named "Summarize Content" might have a variable for the content to be summarized. Users would select this template and provide the content, and the system would generate the prompt.

**7. Messaging and Conversation**

*   **`messages`:**
    *   **System Interaction:** Stores the individual messages within a thread, including user messages, system messages, and AI responses.  This is the core of the conversation functionality.
    *   **Code Abstraction:** A `Message` model.  This model will handle message content, relationships to users and threads, and metadata about LLM usage (tokens, cost, etc.).
    *   **User Experience:** Represents the messages that users see and interact with within a thread. The `role` field distinguishes between user messages, AI responses, and system messages.
    * **Example:** Jane Doe asks a question in a thread.  A `messages` record is created with her question, the `user_id`, the `thread_id`, and the `role` set to "user." The AI responds; another `messages` record is created with the response, linked to the same thread, with the `role` set to "assistant."

*   **`message_relationships`:**
    *   **System Interaction:** Defines parent-child relationships *between* messages, allowing for branching conversations and alternative responses.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  Often handled through self-referential relationships in ORM frameworks (e.g., `Message.parent`, `Message.children`).
    *   **User Experience:**  Allows for more complex conversation structures, such as exploring different AI response options or creating sub-discussions within a message thread.
        * **Example:**  The AI provides an initial response. Jane Doe asks for clarification. The clarification message is a child of the original response message, creating a branch in the conversation.

*   **`message_context_items`:**
    *   **System Interaction:** Tracks *which* content items (and potentially specific chunks) were actually used as context for a *specific* AI message. This is crucial for understanding how the AI arrived at its response.
    *   **Code Abstraction:** Likely handled through relationships in your ORM.  You might have a `Message.context_items` property.
    *   **User Experience:** Might be exposed to users in a "context" panel or used internally for debugging and analysis. This provides transparency into the AI's reasoning process.
        * **Example:**  When the AI responds to Jane Doe's question, this table records which content items from the thread were used to generate the response, along with their relevance scores.

**8. Usage and Statistics**

*   **`usage_stats`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  Tracks various usage metrics, such as API calls, token consumption, and storage usage.  Essential for billing, resource management, and monitoring.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  Likely handled by a `UsageService` or similar, which would record usage data based on events in the application.
    *   **User Experience:**  Generally invisible to end-users, except perhaps for high-level usage summaries in their account settings.  Administrators would use this data for billing and resource planning.
    * **Example:** Every time an LLM is used, a record is added to `usage_stats`, recording the number of tokens used, the cost, the user, and the project.

**9. Context and Search Configurations**

*   **`context_templates`:**
      *   **System Interaction:** Allows for defining pre-configured sets of rules and parameters for how content is selected and presented as context to the LLM.
      *   **Code Abstraction:** A `ContextTemplate` model. Your code would use these templates to build the context for LLM interactions.
      *   **User Experience:**  Users might be able to select different context templates for different tasks, or templates might be applied automatically based on the thread type or other settings.
        *  **Example:** A template named "Detailed Analysis" might prioritize content with high relevance scores and include more context, while a template named "Quick Summary" might be more restrictive.

*   **`search_configurations`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  Allows for defining different search configurations (full-text, semantic, hybrid) and their parameters.
    *   **Code Abstraction:** A `SearchConfiguration` model.  Your search service would use these configurations to perform different types of searches.
    *   **User Experience:**  Users might be able to choose different search types or configure search settings.  This affects how search results are generated and ranked.

**10. Knowledge Graph Settings**

*   **`knowledge_graph_configurations`:**
    * **System Interaction:** Defines settings for how the knowledge graph is constructed and visualized, including node types, relationship types, and display settings.
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  A `KnowledgeGraphConfiguration` model.  This model would be used by the code that interacts with Neo4j and the visualization components.
    *   **User Experience:** Administrators might configure these settings to customize the knowledge graph's appearance and behavior.  These settings affect how the knowledge graph is presented to users.

**11. Real-Time Collaboration**

*   **`user_sessions`:**
    *   **System Interaction:** Tracks active user sessions, providing information about connected users and their devices. Essential for presence awareness and real-time updates.
    *   **Code Abstraction:** A `UserSession` model, likely managed by your authentication and real-time communication infrastructure.
    *   **User Experience:**  Used to show who's currently online and active within the system.
    * **Example:** When Jane Doe logs in, a `user_sessions` record is created, tracking her session ID, client ID, and other information.

*   **`resource_presence`:**
    *   **System Interaction:** Tracks which users are currently viewing or editing which resources (projects, threads, content items).  Provides fine-grained presence information.
    *   **Code Abstraction:** A `ResourcePresence` model, managed by your real-time communication system.
    *   **User Experience:** Used to show who's currently viewing or editing a specific resource, enabling features like co-editing indicators and collaborative awareness.
    * **Example:**  When Jane Doe opens a specific thread, a `resource_presence` record is created, indicating that she's viewing that thread.

*   **`operations_log`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  The heart of the CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) implementation.  Records *every* operation performed on collaborative resources, enabling conflict-free merging and real-time synchronization.
    *   **Code Abstraction:** An `Operation` model, managed by your CRDT library and synchronization logic.
    *   **User Experience:**  Invisible to the user directly, but enables seamless real-time collaboration without conflicts.  Ensures that all users see a consistent view of the data, even when editing simultaneously.
    * **Example:** Jane Doe and John Doe are both editing the same document.  Every keystroke, every formatting change, is recorded as an operation in the `operations_log`. The CRDT algorithm uses these operations to merge changes without conflicts.

*   **`resource_locks`:**
    * **System Interaction:** An additional mechanism for explicit control over the concurrent access to resources, for cases where optimistic locking (via CRDT) is insufficient
    *   **Code Abstraction:** A `ResourceLock` model. Your code would use this to manage locks, potentially as a fallback for certain types of operations.
    *   **User Experience:**  Might be used to prevent users from editing the same section of a document simultaneously or to provide "intention" locks (e.g., "I'm about to edit this").

*   **`broadcast_events`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  A queue for real-time events that need to be broadcast to connected clients (e.g., "user updated content," "new message").
    *   **Code Abstraction:**  Likely handled by your real-time communication infrastructure (e.g., Phoenix Channels, WebSockets).
    *   **User Experience:** Enables real-time updates without requiring users to refresh the page.  Provides a responsive and collaborative experience.
    *   **Example**: When Jane edits content, a record is added to `broadcast_events` and sent to all other users.

*   **`collaboration_workspaces`:**
    *   **System Interaction**: Stores shared state information for collaborative workspaces (e.g., a shared view of a knowledge graph, a collaborative whiteboard).
    *   **Code Abstraction**: A `CollaborationWorkspace` model.  Your code would manage the shared state and synchronize it across users.
    *   **User Experience:**  Enables features where multiple users can interact with the same shared space in real time.

*   **`collaborative_selections`:**
    *   **System Interaction:** Tracks users' cursors and selections in real-time, enabling features like shared cursors and collaborative highlighting.
    *   **Code Abstraction:** A `CollaborativeSelection` model.
    *   **User Experience:** Allows users to see each other's cursors and selections, enhancing the collaborative editing experience.
    *  **Example:** Jane and John view the same document. Jane sees John's cursor.

*   **`conflict_resolutions`:**
    *   **System Interaction:**  Records instances where conflicts occurred (e.g., simultaneous edits that couldn't be automatically merged) and how they were resolved.
    *   **Code Abstraction:** A `ConflictResolution` model.  Your conflict resolution logic would use this to track and manage conflicts.
    *   **User Experience:**  Might be used to present conflict resolution options to users or to provide an audit trail of how conflicts were handled.

*   **`realtime_annotations`:**
    *  **System Interaction:** Stores real-time comments, highlights, and suggestions made by users on specific resources.
    * **Code Abstraction**: `RealtimeAnnotation` model.
    * **User Experience**:  Allows users to collaborate through comments and annotations that appear in real-time, facilitating discussion and feedback.

**12. Views and Materialized Views**

*   **`project_members_view`:**  A simplified view of project membership information.
*   **`token_usage_summary`:**  A materialized view for efficient reporting of token usage.
*   **`active_project_users`:**  A materialized view for quickly seeing who's active in a project.

**13. Triggers and Functions**

*   **`update_session_activity()`:**  Updates the `last_activity_at` timestamp in `user_sessions`.
*   **`sync_to_neo4j()`:**  A placeholder for the function that would synchronize changes to Neo4j.
*   **`update_timestamp()`:**  Automatically updates the `updated_at` timestamp on tables.
*    **`refresh_token_usage_summary()`:** refreshes view
*   **`refresh_active_users()`:** refreshes view.
* **`set_tenant_context()`**: set the config.

**14. Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies**

*   These policies enforce tenant isolation, ensuring that users can only access data within their own tenant.

**15. Additional Constraints**

*   Additional data validation rules.

This completes the overview of the PostgreSQL schema. By understanding the purpose and relationships of each table, you can build a robust and well-integrated system that meets the requirements of ContextNexus. Remember that the code abstractions (models, services, etc.) are the bridge between the database schema and the user experience.
